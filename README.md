step 1 :
first i subset activity label in yfiles and subject labels then merage them with xfiles into 2 datasets (testdata and train data)
scound i merage the two data frame(testdata and train data) into one data frame (dataset)

step 2 :
subset the columns which matches mean() and std()

step 3 :
make descriptive variable name by adding the activity names to the activity column

step 4 :
make the variable names readable by using featurs names

step 5 :
making data set by sumarising the dataset by acvtivity column and subject column
